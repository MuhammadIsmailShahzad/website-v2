I’ve been in the industry for over 10 years now and worked for all kinds of companies, ranging from own startup (crowd-funded online journalism), over big corporate (IBM), to established African business data startup (Asoko Insight). I am now a filter engineer at eyeo trying to make the web a fair, open, and safe place for everybody.</p> <p>I love working with kids and teenagers, cooking, and doing music—I just recently started drum lessons!</p> <h3 id="how-did-you-first-hear-about-frictionless-data"><a href="#how-did-you-first-hear-about-frictionless-data" class="header-anchor">#</a> How did you first hear about Frictionless Data?</h3> <p>I’ve been following the work of the Open Knowledge Foundation for a while now and contributed to the German branch as a mentor for the teenage hackathon weekends project “Jugend Hackt” (Youth Hacks). I first heard about the Frictionless Data program when the OKF announced funding by the Sloan Foundation in 2018. After watching Serah Njambi Rono’s talk on Youtube (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Ranx9Jz0Ro" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Ranx9Jz0Ro<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-hidden="true" x="0px" y="0px" viewBox="0 0 100 100" width="15" height="15" class="icon outbound"><path fill="currentColor" d="M18.8,85.1h56l0,0c2.2,0,4-1.8,4-4v-32h-8v28h-48v-48h28v-8h-32l0,0c-2.2,0-4,1.8-4,4v56C14.8,83.3,16.6,85.1,18.8,85.1z"></path> <polygon fill="currentColor" points="45.7,48.7 51.3,54.3 77.2,28.5 77.2,37.2 85.2,37.2 85.2,14.9 62.8,14.9 62.8,22.9 71.5,22.9"></polygon></svg></a>) and reading about the Reproducible Research Tool Fund on Twitter, I knew I wanted to contribute.</p> <h3 id="why-did-you-apply-for-a-tool-fund-grant"><a href="#why-did-you-apply-for-a-tool-fund-grant" class="header-anchor">#</a> Why did you apply for a Tool Fund grant?</h3> <p>I first heard about the concepts and challenges around Reproducible Research when taking the MOOC “Data Science” from Johns Hopkins University on Coursera. Since I had my fair share of work inside proprietary data formats and tools, I was happy to see that there are people out there making serious efforts to remedy the loss of attribution and data manipulation steps. After browsing through OKF’s Frictionless Data website, I was even happier that there are actual tools, libraries, and standards already available. Applying for the tool fund and contributing my own humble idea was a no-brainer for me.</p> <h3 id="what-specific-issues-are-you-looking-to-address-with-the-tool-fund"><a href="#what-specific-issues-are-you-looking-to-address-with-the-tool-fund" class="header-anchor">#</a> What specific issues are you looking to address with the Tool Fund?</h3> <p>My goal is to add a Data Package import/export add-on to Google Sheets. I understand that a lot of data wrangling is still done in Sheets, Excel, and files being swapped around. A lot of information is lost that way. Where did the data initially come from? How was it manipulated, cleaned, or otherwise altered? How can we feed spreadsheets back into a Reproducible Research pipeline? I think Data Packages is a brilliant format to model and preserve exactly that information. While I do not want to lure people away from the tools they are already familiar with, I think we can bridge the gap between Google Sheets and Frictionless Data by making Data Packages a first-class citizen.</p> <h3 id="how-can-the-open-data-open-source-community-engage-with-the-work-you-are-doing-around-frictionless-data-google-sheets-add-on"><a href="#how-can-the-open-data-open-source-community-engage-with-the-work-you-are-doing-around-frictionless-data-google-sheets-add-on" class="header-anchor">#</a> How can the open data, open source, community engage with the work you are doing around Frictionless Data Google Sheets add-on?</h3> <p>I think open source and data is a unique and wonderful opportunity to get access to the “wisdom of the crowd” and ensure that software and information is and remains accessible to everyone. In the first few weeks I will focus on getting a first prototype and sufficient documentation up, so you can all play with the Data Package import/export add-on as soon as possible. After that, I invite you to take a look at our Github repository (<a href="https://github.com/frictionlessdata/googlesheets-datapackage-tools" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://github.com/frictionlessdata/googlesheets-datapackage-tools<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-hidden="true" x="0px" y="0px" viewBox="0 0 100 100" width="15" height="15" class="icon outbound"><path fill="currentColor" d="M18.8,85.1h56l0,0c2.2,0,4-1.8,4-4v-32h-8v28h-48v-48h28v-8h-32l0,0c-2.2,0-4,1.8-4,4v56C14.8,83.3,16.6,85.1,18.8,85.1z"></path> <polygon fill="currentColor" points="45.7,48.7 51.3,54.3 77.2,28.5 77.2,37.2 85.2,37.2 85.2,14.9 62.8,14.9 62.8,22.9 71.5,22.9"></polygon></svg></a>), play around with the tool, and contribute. Raising an issue, opening a pull request, improving the documentation, giving feedback on the user experience—everything counts! I am so stoked to be part of this Frictionless Data journey and can’t wait to see what we will accomplish. Thank you very much in advance!</p></div></div><div class="global-ui"></div></div>
